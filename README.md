# Music
A lightweight CLI music playing program that has better shuffling than standard music players. Isn't complete yet, many things will break. With that said, "normal" mp3 and wav files can be played.

# Using
To use a non-released version of Music (they most likely will at least work), download the `Installer.exe` and run it. In the install directory, run `Music.exe`, or run one of the shortcuts the installer created. Alternatively, download `bin/Music.exe` as well as ffmpeg dlls, place them in the same directory, and run `Music.exe`.  
To use a released version of Music, follow the same procedure as above, except get the files from the release page. (You won't be able to use the second method)  
  
  
Next release of Music will be after the UI is functional (soon!).
