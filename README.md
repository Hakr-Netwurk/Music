# Music
A lightweight CLI music playing program that has better shuffling than standard music players. Isn't complete yet, many things will break. With that said, "normal" mp3 and wav files can be played.

# Using
To use a non-released version of Music (they most likely will at least work), first get the `Music.exe` file from `Music\x64\Release`, then the `dlls.zip` file. Unzip `dlls.zip` to the same directory as `Music.exe`, and run `Music.exe`.  
To use a released version of Music, follow the same procedure as above, except get the files from the release page.  
  
Installer might be a thing in the future, unsure for now.
