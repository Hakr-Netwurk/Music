# Music
A lightweight CLI music playing program that has better shuffling than standard music players. Isn't complete yet, many things will break. With that said, "normal" mp3 and wav files can be played.

# Using
To use a non-released version of Music (they most likely will at least work), first get the `Music.exe` file from `Music\x64\Release`, then the `dlls.zip` file. Unzip `dlls.zip` to the same directory as `Music.exe`, and run `Music.exe`.  
To use a released version of Music, follow the same procedure as above, except get the files from the release page.  

  
Installer might be a thing in the future, unsure for now.  
  
Next release of Music will be after the UI is functional (soon!).  
We are currently working on a UWP app. That means there will be no more ui changes, and the only things that will be functional in the console ui will be pause/play, previous, and next. The rest will remain there because I'm lazy.  
There seems to be an issue where only I (supsm) can run the app, and it crashes for everyone else (so far). I will investigate this issue a bit further, but either way it *should* be fixed in the UWP version.
